# CodeTrack - An Interactive Coding Assignment Platform

> Author: [Suryateja Duvvuri](https://github.com/SuryatejaDuvvuri)

## **Note**

- This project is still work in progress because I still have more components to work on but feel free to contact me for questions, or suggestions to improve this application.

#### Motivation
> Huge thanks to websites like leetcode, codingbat and codesignal as they gave them inspiration for me to make my version of a coding website. Thanks to my professor for motivating me to do this project as he was opening up to his thoughts about AI in education. This application is like any other Traditional coding practice platforms but this is driven by AI to assist students into solving problems rather than relying on AI. Additionally, this application also restricts students from accessing other websites or LLM to prevent them from skipping the foundations and encourage them to struggle through coding problems. Besides, CodeTrack provides dynamic progress results, assignment list to students, and instructor tools to assign or create problems relevant to their course content.

#### General Description
> CodeTrack is a full-stack web application that enables students to practice coding problems, track their progress, and manage assignments. Instructors can assign problems, monitor student achievement, and generate passcodes for verified completion. The platform features interactive dashboards, real-time progress bars, and a to-do list to motivate students.
